                    <h3>The Problem - </h3>
                    <p>Many people with mental health issues can get overwhelmed by the amount of things they have to do, and their anxiety only gets exacerbated by the crowded and sterile UI of popular reminder apps on the market.</p>
                    <h3>The Solution - </h3>
                    <p>Design and implement a cross platform application with a minimal UI and feature set to gently remind users of the things they need to do. </p>
                    <h3>What <em>I</em> did - </h3>
                    <p>I worked with three other students in the research and validation phases, as well as in implementation. <br> I was solely responsible for the design system/visual language, and high fidelity prototypes. I was also in charge of leading and managing the UX portion of the project in general.</p>

                    <p><em>Our team reviewed 10 research papers on ICT-solutions on mental health as well as the ties between forgetfulness and mental-health. </em></p>
                    <p>The most important takeaways were - </p>
                    <p>1. Based on research analyzing mental-health app reviews, users value user interface and the user friendliness of the app. They also appreciate customization and designing for trust. <a class="source" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1460458219896492">(Source)</a></p>
                    <p>2. Keep it simple - don't overload the user's cognitive load, especially when designing for those with mental-health concerns. <a class="source" href="https://humanfactors.jmir.org/2017/1/e1/" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p>

                    <p><em>We looked 12 different existing ICT-based systems related to mental health reminders and identified our market niche. </em></p>
                    <p>Between the twelve applications, the common complaints were feature bloat and pricing. Most reminder apps were too robust for our target audience's use cases, resulting in clunky UI and and overall poor experience. Additionally, most of the apps that were mental-health focused featured payment systems.</p>
                    <p>We found that there were <strong>no 100% free apps</strong> with a <strong>friendly, intuitive user experience</strong> to simply remind users of short term things to come. </p>

                    <h3>Sketches and wireframing</h3>
                    <p class="m3">We chose our ideation approach based off our core philosophy of simple and friendly UI. A short-form rapid ideation session with sketches on post it notes gave us a rough idea of what screens we wanted to fit our minimal feature-list into. We spent roughly 8-10 seconds on each post-it note, attempting to suppress our inner editors and simply extract pure ideas to work with. </p>
                    <p class="m3">Once we figured that out, we went into a more formal round of sketching, picking the layouts we enjoyed from the post-it note exercise and expanding on those. This time, I encouraged the team to go a little bit more in depth into exploring the functionality in order to prime us into thinking about how users will end up interacting with the app and what their 'happy path' would look like. </p>
                    <p class="m3"> After that, we agreed on a core set of screens for our feature set and refined these wire frames digitally just to make sure early on that we were on the same page layout-wise, and nothing would be lost in translation between our scribbles and our actual product. </p>

                    <h2>Prototyping - </h2>
                    <p class="m3">Once we had our interaction paradigms and general app flow locked down, it was time to get into prototyping. Typically, I'd work with a lower fidelity functional prototype and move on from there, but since the core identity of our app is based on 'look and feel', higher fidelity prototypes were necessary from the get-go. <em>Luckily, since the app is designed to be minimal with few screens, this decision didn't end up eating too much of our team's resources.</em> </p>
                    <p class="m3">We then set out to validate our initial design choices with a very preliminary and casual phase of user testing. Since a lot of friends and family members fall under the target demographics of this app, I conducted 2-3 casual interviews to gauge what was working and what wasn't. </p>

                    <p class="m3">With the high fidelity prototype in hand, we conducted a more formal round of user testing. Our goal for our project was to create something simple that is intuitive to use. With that in mind, our validation was set up to test 1) the speed and ease of which users are able to conduct basic tasks, and 2) whether or not, after on boarding, app gestures felt natural. </p>

                    <img class="m3" src="./assets/mental-reminder/user-testing-fixes.png" width="80%"></img>
                    <p class="m3">The four formal user tests conducted validated our theories on the general usage and gestures. The key changes we made as a result of user testing was modifying the swipe right gesture on a reminder to complete the reminder instead of snooze - the rationale behind this was that most people who snooze from the push notification. If they were actively checking the home screen, it would make sense to enable them to complete a task ahead of time, a use case that we
                    overlooked during ideation.</p>
                    <p class="m3">We also made sure to clarify any affordances that weren't immediately obvious to the user. The user testing sessions offered us valuable insight into what features were valued and what features could be further cut to reduce bloat. Although our script and sample tasks were built around a 'happy path' user story, often times the user would lead us off script in a direction that would ultimately prove enlightening - for example, learning that our ambiguous notification system felt 'condescending' rather than 'friendly' was something that never occurred to us due to our proximity to the project.</p>
