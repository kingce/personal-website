Knowing this, we had to not only make sure that our design was feasible to implement within a 2-3 week time frame, but also we had to manage our time well during prototyping. </p>

                        <p>Luckily, the instructor was extremely ‘hands-off’ during the design portion, which allowed me to suggest practicing lean ux to prototype and validate our designs.

                        <h2>Setting a Reminder</h2>
                        <p>It was important to us that setting a reminder would be as easy as possible - we believe that if we provide an easy first step, users would be more inclined to follow through with the task to completion. </p>

                        <p>That’s why we added preset reminders, so reminders can be set for common things with just one tap. For new reminders, users can swipe through the numerical inputs and tap options. We wanted to limit keyboard input as much as possible, since those require both hands and impede the flow ever so slightly.</p>

                        <p>Although users noted that scheduling reminders in advance (triggering a reminder on a specific day) seemed to be out of scope, we wanted to allow for period reminders to exercise, meditate, or even just to drink water. </p>
                        <p>With this, we knew we had to create a separate flow and distinction between recurring reminders and regular reminders. We decided to use color as the main differentiator, and reinforce this by giving recurring reminders their own page so users can toggle and edit these.</p>

                        <h2>Reminder logs</h2>
                        <p>A lot of people that we had talked to in our user interviews noted that they don’t just forget to do things - sometimes they forget whether they’d done them at all. This is particularly important for use cases such as medication. If someone uses our app to take their medicine and forget, there’s a chance they might take it twice. </p>
                        <p>So we created the reminder log page, where all completed and cancelled reminders can be viewed. This way, even the most forgetful user won’t have to worry about whether or not they’d done something.</p>

                        <p>During our systematic literature review, we learned that positive reinforcement and reflection can be a great feature for apps targeting mental health and productivity. </p>
                        <p>We decided to add a profile page even though the app is designed to be offline and isolated. By reminding the user of how far they’d come and providing interesting statistics, we hoped that this would encourage them to continue their positive and productive streak into the future. </p>

                        <p>At this point, I had a few larger UX projects under my belt and felt confident in designing a product to fit a brief. However, this was my first time doing both the design and implementation, and I learned that you can’t plan for every outcome. </p>

                        <p>This taught me a valuable lesson about expectations in product design and learning to adapt to whatever comes up.</p>
