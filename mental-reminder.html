                    <p>During winter of 2020, our professor approached our team with the open ended challenge of designing and implementing a human-centric product that catered towards mental health.</p>
                    <p>Our team of four computer scientists created Mental Reminder, a cross platform application to gently remind users of the recurring things that need to get done. I was solely responsible for the complete design of the application and also contributed to the front end development.</p>

                        <p>Many people with mental health issues can get overwhelmed by the amount of things they have to do, and their anxiety only gets exacerbated by the crowded and sterile UI of popular reminder apps on the market.</p>

                        <p>Our goal for this project was to research, design, and ultimately implement a cross platform application with a minimal UI and feature-set to gently remind users of the things they need to do in a way that’s unobtrusive and easy to use.</p>

                    <p>We have a lot of competition as far as reminder apps go - however, we had a clear goal to cater to mental-health reminders in both the look and feel or our app. We had to do focused research on how we can cater to our target audience through our UX choices.</p>

                    <p>At the end of the day, this project was for a computer science course, and after the design phase, we only had 4 weeks to implement. From a project management perspective, we had to make sure that what we wanted to implement was actually within the scope of the course.</p>

                        <p>From this, we learned about that:</p>
                        <p>1. Users value the user interface and friendliness particularly high in mental-health focused apps</p>
                        <p>2. When designing specifically for mental health, it's important to keep it simple and not overwhelm the user's cognitive load</p>

                        <p>Between the twelve applications examined, the common complaints were feature bloat and pricing. Most reminder apps were too robust for our target audience's use cases, resulting in clunky UI and and overall poor experience. Additionally, most of the apps that were mental-health focused featured subscriptions or had most of their features locked behind paywalls.</p>
