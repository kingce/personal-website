                    <p>Our multidisciplinary team was tasked with focusing on the guest experience. In a little under three months, we produced a scalable, guest-facing solution that would help Airbnb promote environmentally friendly behavior.</p>

                    <p>We had a good idea of the core flow going into wireframing, but we stayed open minded. This helped us to expand on our ideas as we went along. </p>
                    <p>For example, while making screens for the listings, we also came up with the idea of creating the ‘hub page’ for all the Eco information. A large part of where our touch points for this new program would come from our wireframing efforts.</p>

This was made possible due to there being an existing Airbnb DLS (design language system) that we had to adhere to, which meant that we didn’t have to design anything new. Instead, all we had to do was imitate existing assets.</p>

                    <p>In typical designer fashion, we wanted to solve all of our problems with pretty badges or clever visual design. Our first round of user testing showed us that sometimes it’s better to just keep it simple with the copy writing and make affordances abundantly and unambiguously known.</p>

                    <p><em>After changing our copy, our second round of testing saw a 100% success rate (5/5) with tasks involving that change, which was a marked improvement from before.</em></p>

                <h3>Creating purposeful touchpoints</h3>
                <p>One of the things we quickly realized while working with Ryan was that a centralized location wasn't practical and didn't fit in with the platform's design ethos - instead, we created multiple ways to get to the page. User testing later confirmed that this was more effective than keeping it tucked away in the nav or in one location.</p>

                    <h3>Booking a stay with credits</h3>
                    <p>A major pain point we identified early on during our user flows was that users couldn't be sustainable even if they wanted to, since there was virtually no sustainability information on the listings. We made sure to add icons and information so that users can see which hosts had sustainable stays.</p>
                    <p>The rest of the checkout flow is more or less the same - we built our feature into the existing flow without the addition of any new screens to make the process as unobtrusive as possible.</p>

                    <h3>Using credits with local business</h3>
                    <p>Similar to the eco hub page, we made sure to made the shop listings accessible through multiple touch points as well - this information is available through the trips tab, but it's also available through several touch points on the eco hub page as well.</p>
                    <p>All users would have to do is to find a discount that interests them, pull up a QR code, and scan it at the relevant business. We did some preliminary research with popular POS system's APIs to make sure that this was feasible, and the integration should be fairly seamless with Airbnb's app.</p>
