                        <p>This was the open ended brief given to us by Ryan Scott, a design lead at Airbnb and our project manager.</p>
                        <p>During Spring 2021, WWU and Airbnb teamed up to explore the various ways in which the company could address the various environmental and sustainability concerns that inherently arise from being a key player in the travel industry.</p>

                        <p>Over the course of a little under three months, we produced a scalable, guest-facing solution that would help Airbnb promote environmentally friendly behavior.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h5 class="small-title">Open Ended Brief</h5>
                        <p>As a capstone course, both the brief as well as our methodologies were left fairly open ended, giving us both the freedom and burden of choice.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h5 class="small-title">Designing big</h5>
                        <p>Airbnb is a pretty big company - not only did we need to address the open ended nature of the prompt, we also needed to make sure our solution would fit in with the company size and vision.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h5 class="small-title">Working with a DLS</h5>
                        <p>Airbnb already has a comprehensive and thorough DLS in place - this helped the speed of our iterations but also limited our approaches in designing and exploring certain concepts. </p>

                        <p>We compensated for the open ended nature of the brief by being as comprehensive as possible during our research in order to make sure we were asking the right questions.</p>

                        <p>After we made sure that we were asking the right questions, we wanted to explore a breadth of answers that would be impactful yet scalable depending on the business needs of the company.</p>

                    <div>

                        <p>We leveraged the existing DLS to iterate quickly on high fidelity prototypes - this helped us narrow in on our problems extremely early on. Through our iterations, we learned how to adapt to Airbnb’s current mobile design ethos.</p>

                        <p>We examined existing research done by Airbnb, and conducted both market as well as competitor research to help gauge traveler sentiment on sustainability. </p>
                        <p>For our market research, we capitalized on pre-existing reports and surveys conducted by companies with a larger reach and more resources than ours for our market research. From these, <strong>we found that guests do care about sustainability - it’s just “much less important to consumers than things like price, type of destination, convenience and amenities”</strong>.</p>

                    <div class="col">
                        <p>We also found through competitor research that very few competitors offered ways to guide guests to sustainable stays, and even less made attempts to educate their audience on sustainability principles. </p>
                        <p>However, Uber stood out with a solid plan for reaching zero-emissions. Additionally, our research on Airbnb indicated that they already had a history of partnering with policymakers and NGO’s.

                <p class="ws-bottom-5">We had a good idea of the core flow going into wireframing, but we stayed open minded. While making screens for the listings, we also came up with the idea of creating the ‘hub page’ for all the Eco information. A large part of where our touch points for this new program would come from our wireframing efforts.</p>

                <h5 class="small-title">Touch points had to be negotiated</h5>
                <p>In our initial pitch of the idea to the project manager, we discussed where touch points for the hub page would be located. We learned that in a product as large as Airbnb, you had to fight for any amount of space on the home screen or the nav. Luckily, we planned a range from high-impact to low-impact touch point placement, so we were able to discuss freely and come up with a compromise between the last two low-impact screens during the limited meetings that we had.</p>

Instead, all we had to do was imitate existing assets. </p>
