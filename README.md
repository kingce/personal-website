# personal-website
Personal website via GitHub Pages cos I'm broke and can't afford hosting.

### Notes
This is the first website I've ever built from scratch. I'm aware there are services out there that make it a lot easier to make a website with virtually no coding whatsover, but I had time to kill this summer and thought, 'Hey, why not learn the basics of web design', and boy was this a great way to learn. 

Any criticisms or questions just shoot me a DM.
