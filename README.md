# personal-website
Personal website via GitHub Pages cos I'm broke and can't afford hosting

## Frameworks Used
Pretty simple and straightforward. HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with some Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery thrown in. 

## Future To-Do's 
This website is pretty much done for all intents and purposes because I'm busy with coursework. When I have time, I'll fix the following - 
- [ ] Re-style landing page 
- [ ] Fix the janky animations 
- [ ] Adjust padding on mobile 
- [ ] (If I ever become not-broke) Get a nicer domain name


## Notes
This is the first website I've ever built from scratch. I'm aware there are services out there that make it a lot easier to make a website with virtually no coding whatsover, but I had time to kill this summer and thought, 'Hey, why not learn the basics of web design', and boy was this a great way to learn. 

Any criticisms or questions just shoot me a DM.
