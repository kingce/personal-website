                    <p>The first year of COVID presented a couple of unique challenges for Fall Move-In. University Housing decided to make an app to schedule and manage the Move-In times for Fall 2020.</p>

                    <p>As a member of the design team at Restek, I was presented with the unique opportunity to design a web-app and be a part of the product's journey from start to finish.</p>

                    <h3>"How might we facilitate a socially distanced move-in process?"</h3>

                    <p>We’ve all heard the words “in these unprecedented times” at least a billion times by now, but back towards the end of Summer 2020, University Housing was only starting to realize that COVID wasn’t going away anytime soon. </p>
                    <p>And that meant a socially distanced move-in. </p>
                    <p>Move-in is an inherently messy time for any university, but the added challenge of an unprecented global pandemic forced us to revisit the process entirely and design around quarantine constraints.</p>

                    <h3>Create a web-app to provide information and manage move-in timeslots</h3>
                    <p>Since a lot of the move-in process info was already handled digitally, University Housing decided to further commit by creating specific timeslots for move-in and hosting that experience on a new web-app that expands on the current process. </p>
                    <p>As a designer on the Restek team, I had the privilege of collaborating in a multidisciplinary environment to design the flow and layout of the app on a deadline. </p>

                        <p>The decision to create a new web-app to facilitate move-in was made fairly late in the game. By the time the design team was informed of it, we were left with just a little under two weeks to assist in the design.</p>

                        <p>We were presented with a rough idea of the user flow and a few other logistics - that QR codes would be required on move-in day, that a scheduling page would be needed, as well as some auxiliary pages to display info. </p>

                    <p>In one long afternoon meeting, we ironed out the specific steps in our user flow. Each major step in the move-in process would require its own dedicated page, and while we weren’t given the specifics of what would need to be on each page, we were able to take an educated guess and adjust along the way. </p>
                    <p>Because we were designing on a deadline, a lot of the underlying development was already underway, which also meant we needed to coordinate with the engineering team on priorities and requirements. </p>

The biggest hurdles here were designing the actual scheduling process and placing it within the broader context of the app’s flow, as a lot of the details and specifics weren’t made known to us until well into the design process.</p>

                        <p>We initially wanted to include a calendar widget, but realized that would be inefficient as move-in would at most span a week and there would be multiple options per day for move-in time slots. In the end, we settled for a series of drop downs, which was also more mobile friendly and cut down on development time. </p>

This had the dual benefit of making development easier, as the code for all the components already exists, as well as ensuring that the end product would feel like an extension of the housing website and fit into existing branding.  </p>

                        <p>Luckily, since we were familiar with the HTML/CSS frameworks used by the housing site, we were able to design the desktop layouts in a way such that it would be easy to implement. </p>

                    <p>Despite this not being the most aesthetically striking project, or the most interesting one, I 'm proud of the work we did over those two weeks. This was my first proper UX project outside of case studies, and I felt like I learnt a lot about the process as well as what it meant to collaborate with others in cross-functional teams to meet deadlines.</p>
                    <p>I was satisfied with the overall process and how we approached the design challenge, but there was still a few things I would have changed looking back. </p>

                        <h3>1.<br/>Making time to test</h3>
                        <p>We definitely didn't have a lot of time to work on this project, and in the moment, the design team was so excited to get our hands dirty that we didn't think consciously about the UX process as a whole.</p>
                        <p>We spent all the limited time we had in designing the prototypes and working with the developers, but we definitely should have actively <strong>made</strong> time to test. While we did do some quick and dirty user tests with Restek employees that weren't assigned to this project, it would have been nice to divide up the work to make time for formal user testing.</p>

                    <div class="col">
                        <h3>2.<br/>Tools Matter</h3>
                        <p>Since the other designers were also working on other projects, I was solely responsible for producing high fidelity prototypes. Since speed was a concern, I defaulted to using Illustrator at the time, since that was what I was most comfortable with. However, this made collaboration difficult when other designers wanted to hop in to make small changes.</p>
                        <p>In retrospect, using an online tool like Figma would have saved us time in that regard. Additionally, Figma's built-in CSS tools potentially would have made for an easier hand-off.</p>
