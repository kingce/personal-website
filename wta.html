                        <p>We were intially approached with the open-ended brief to redesign any website, app, or service. As a team of four WWU students who frequently use the bus system in Bellingham, we decided initially to redesign their website.</p>

                        <p>This was born purely out of spite for the clunky and unintuitive system currently in place - the website was the only way to digitally acquire first-party route information from WTA. But the trip planner was convoluted and inaccessible on mobile.</p>

                        <p>We started with a user survey to better understand the behaviors of current WTA riders. We found that the majority of them had access to a smart phone, and that the vast majority turned to Google Maps. Qualitative surveys indicated that mobile solutions were preferred over desktop optimized experiences.</p>
                        <p>It’s worth noting that the reliability of WTA transportation is already fairly tenuous, so users value getting information that feels trustworthy - in other words, they’d prefer first party and branded sources over Google Maps. </p>

                        <p>However, it failed to deliver on one of our core goals - make the app feel first party and branded.</p>
                        <p>This was my first experience doing visual design, and as a result, I didn’t have sufficient design acuity to realize that our current design language drew too much inspiration from Google’s Material Design suite.

                <p>We then selected accent colors by modifying saturation and luminance values from the existing blue, opting to stick with an analogous color scheme so as to not visually overwhelm the users. This also allowed us to place emphasis on any direct calls to actions.</p>
